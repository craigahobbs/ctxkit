# BareScript Tips

Here are a few tips for generating BareScript code:

1. Multi-line BareScript statements require the use of the line-continuation character, `\\`.
   Function definitions, for loops, while loops, and if-else conditionals are not considered
   multi-line statements and so do not require the line-continuation character. For example:

   ```barescript
   function myAppFunction():
       items = { \\
           'A': 1, \\
           'B': 2 \\
       }
       for item in objectKeys(items):
           markdownPrint('', '- ' + item)
       endfor
   endfunction
   ```

2. The `windowClipboardWrite` function is `async` and any function that calls it must be `async` as
   well. For example:

   ```barescript
   async function myAppCopyText(text):
       windowClipboardWrite(text)
   endfunction
   ```

3. There are no inline function definitions (e.g. `fn = lambda x: x + 1`). in BareScript. All functions
   must be defined in the global scope. For example:

   ```barescript
   function myIncrement(x):
       return x + 1
   endfunction
   ```

4. There is no `await` keyword in BareScript - it is implicit when calling `async` functions.

5. Please use common BareScript best practices:

   - Use lower-case, camel-case for variables and function names
   - Prefix your globals with your application prefix (e.g. `myAppCategories`)
   - Define your main entry point in a "main" function (e.g. `myAppMain`)

   For example:

   ```barescript
   function myAppMain():
       # Render the title
       title = 'Hello, World!'
       documentSetTitle(title)
       markdownPrint('# ' + markdownEscape(title))

       # Render the names
       for name in myAppNames:
           markdownPrint('', 'Hello, ' + name + '!')
       endfor
   endfunction

   # The names to say "hello" to
   myAppNames = [ \\
       'World', \\
       'Pussy Cat' \\
   ]

   myAppMain()
   ```

6. Always follow the BareScript common blank line rules:

   - ensure function definitions and global statement groups are separated by two blank lines

   - within functions, ensure code statement groups are separated by a single blank line

   - within conditional blocks, ensure code statement groups are separated by a single blank line


7. Always follow the BareScript common commenting rules:

   - ensure function definitions and global statement groups are adequately commented

   - within functions, ensure code statement groups are adequately commented

   - within conditional blocks, ensure code statement groups are adequately commented
